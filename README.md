# VMB

This is my first attempt at creating a program, during my first year of college, self-learning. The purpose of the program is to manage the attendance of the daily workers on a blueberry farm throughout the entire harvesting season.

# Challenge

The majority of the workers would use different first names when they presented themselves, and I had to find a solution to track the attendance of the same individual without duplicating their records.
